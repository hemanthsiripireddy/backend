// when you want to test locally, you can just test each class or method,
this doesn't require to spin up required services. so when we unit test method or class
it might use other services or databases or queues or something, we can use mockito/stub
to mock to everything. so we can test a module or class in isolation
--even we can use this test strategy to debug and find issues in certain methods or classes

--for integration testing, we can use inmemory database or in memory queues or test containers
--we can use wire mock to mock external services

--for comprehensive testing or end to end testing, we can use docket compose
this is heavier but useful
--we can decrease use of mocks to increase integration testing
