Rule Design Principles
    Rule dependency: A rule should not depend on any other rule
    Rule Atomicity: A rule should be designed as simple as possbile
    data defines the rule to fire next

Ordering of rules
    salience
    agenda groups
    salience +agenda groups
activation groups
    only one rule is triggered and only one time from the activation group
--you can set expiration date for any rule
--you can insert new facts into session by drools rule
    you can get all the facts from the session into java code
--insertlogical
    insert a fact into the session
    existence of the inserted object is tied with the truth of the when-side of the rule
    if expression on when-side is false, the face is removed
--fact objects
--use drools event listeners for debugging

--exits: only one time when is triggered
--for all- if you want to test a specific expression is valid for all: use for all
--if you find min or max in the collection, use for all
