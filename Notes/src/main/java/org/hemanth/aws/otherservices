cloudFormation:
    cloud formation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources(most of them are supported)
    within a cloud format template, we can say, 
        i want a security group
        i wnat two EC2 instances
    then cloud formation creates these rosources in right order
    benefits:
        infrastructure as code:
            no resources are manually created, which is excellet for control
            changes to the infrastructure are revived through code

        cost:
            each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
            we can estimate the costs of our resources using cloud formation template
            saving strategy: in Dev,    we could do automation deletion of templates at 5pm and recreated at 8pm 
        productivity:
            ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
            automated generation of diagram for your templates
            declarative programming(no need to figure out ordering or orchestration)
        don't re-invent the wheel
            leverage the existing templates on the web
            leverage the documentation
        supports all AWS resources

AWS Outpost:
    Hybrid cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure along side a cloud infrastructure
    therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems, 
        one for AWS cloud(using the AWS console, CLI, AWS APIs)
        one for their onpremise infrastructure
    AWS OutPosts are server racks that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, apis and tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud
    AWS will set up and manage  Outposts Racks within your on-premise infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on premises
    you are responsible for Outpost rack security
    Benefits:
        low-latency access to on-premises systems
        local data processing
        data residency
        easier migration from on-premises to cloud
        Fully manged service
    some services that  work on outpose are 
        EC2, EBS, S3, EKS, ECS, RDS, EMR
