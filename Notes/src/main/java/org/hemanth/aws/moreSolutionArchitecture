SQS- simple queue service- pull
SNS- simple notificaiton service- push
Kineses- streaming
Event Bridge- routing based on rules

Caching strategies:
    Cache-aside-lazy loading
    write through
    write behind
    read through
    refresh ahead
    TTL time to live

blocking an IP address:
    NACL, Security Group, ALB, AWS WAF, cloud front

High performance computing(HPC):
    the cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC
    we can create high number of resources in no time
    we can pay only for the systems you have used

    perform genomics, computational chemistry, finanacial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning
    deep learning, autonomous driving
Data management and transfer
    Direct connect
    snowball
    AWS data synch
compute and networking
    CPU optimized
    EC2 placement groups: cluster for good network performance
EC2 enhanced networking
elastic fabric adapter
AWS batch
AWS parallel cluster

High available EC2 instance
    create a stand by EC2 instace  in another AZ, : cloud watch event trigget lamdb function, lamda function creates new instace in another AZ and attaching to same elastic IP address
    auto scaling
        if instance in one AZ is terminated, crate a new instance in another AZ
