--how to choose region
    compliance: government restrict that data should be in the country
    latency: better to choose nearby region for less latency
    services: some regions might not have all services
    pricing: pricing might vary for different regions

-- region contain availability zones
    one region has min 3 and max 6 availability zones
    this zones are for redundant purpose, mean, if one zone is destroyed by disaster, customers still
    have access to their data.

--IAM Policy has
    version, id, statement
    statement has
        sid, effect, principal, action, resource

-- MFA
    three types of devices are there for MFAS
-- different ways to access AWS services
     AWS console using password and MFA
     command line interface- CLI using access key id and secret access key
     Software Development kit -SDK using access key id and secret access key

--aws cloud shell
--aws roles aws services like ec2
    what permissions ec2 has to access other aws resources

-- IAM Security tools
    IAM Credential Report (account-level)
        lists all IAM users and status of their credentials
    IAM Access Advisor (User Level)
        this shows services that the user can access and when those services were last accessed
--EC2
    types of EC2
        general purpose
        computer optimized
        memory optimized ( RAM)
        storage optimized(disk or ssd)


--- to connect to EC2 from local compute using ssh
     ssh -i '.\My Key Pair.pem' ec2-user@54.83.183.21
--EC2 instance purchasing options
    on demand   - very expensive
    spot instance  - very less expensive, given left over instances
    Reserved instances - 1 year - 30% discount
    Reserved instances - 3 years- 60% discount
    EC2 savings plan-  per hour base             28 discount
    Reserved convertible instances- 25% discount
    dedicated host- on demand - separate hardware
    dedicated host reservation
    capacity reservation
-- spot instances and spot fleets

--elastic Ip addresses
    if we associate elastic IP address to Ec2 instance, even after stopping and starting instance,
    public IP address will be same
--placement groups
    cluster
    spread
    partition

--Elastic Network Interface

--EC2 hibernate
    in memory RAM state is preserved

 --EBS elastic block storage
    when EC2 is created,  one EBS is attached to it automatically, when EC2 is deleted, EBS is also deleted automatically
    if we manually attach EBS to EC2, if EC2 is deleted, EBS is not deleted automatically
    EBS snapchat archive
    recycle bin for EBS snapshot
    fast snapshot restore
  --AMI Amazon Machine Image
  --EC2 instance store: very fast, temporary storage, directly attached EC2 instance hardware
  --EBS volume types
    gp2/gp3 -general performance SSD
    io1/io2- highest performance SSD
    st1 -HHD
  --EBS multi attach io1/io2- high performance
        upto 16 instances at a time
  --EFS Amazon Elastic File System
  --ELB elastic Load Balancer
       AWS has 4 types of managed load balancers
       classic load balancer v1- 2009, HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL(secure TCP),
       Application Load Balancer v2-2016, HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket,
       Network Load Balancer v2-2017, TCP, TLS, UDP,
       Gateway Load Balancer 2020 operates at layer  3, IP Protocol
   --application load balancer
        routing tables to different target groups
            routing based on path on URL ex: example.com/user, example.com/post
            routing based on hostname in URL ex: one.example.com, other.example.com
            routing based on query string in URL ex: example.com/users?id=10
         ALB is great fit for microservices and container based applications
   target group
   --gateway load balancer
        if we want filter traffic by passing to firewall, or something, we use gateway load balancer
        if operates at layer 3 IP protocol
   --cross zone load balancing vs non-cross zone load balancing
       CZLB is enabled for ALB by default, no charges for that
       CZLB is disabled for NLB and GWLB by default, if we enable, charges will apply
   -- SSL and TLS certificates
       SNI- server name indication
       SNI solves loading multiple SSL certificates to one web server(to serve multiple websites)
   --connection draining
        time to complete inflight requests while the instance is de registering,
        stop sending new requests to the instance which is de registering
   --Auto scaling group
        dynamic scaling
        schedule scaling
        predictive scaling
        good metrics to scale on
            CPU utilization
            request count per target
            average network in/out
--rds
    read replica
    multi AZ or stand by
    RDS Custom
    features of aurora
        automatic failover
        backtrack
    restore vs cloning vs snapshot, backup
    rds proxy
        fully managed database proxy for RDS
        allows to poll and share DB connections established with the database
    Amazon Elasticache
        using Elasticache involves heavy code change in application code
        Redis vs Memcached
