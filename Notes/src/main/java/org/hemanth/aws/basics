--how to choose region
    compliance: government restrict that data should be in the country
    latency: better to choose nearby region for less latency
    services: some regions might not have all services
    pricing: pricing might vary for different regions

-- region contain availability zones
    one region has min 3 and max 6 availability zones
    this zones are for redundant purpose, mean, if one zone is destroyed by disaster, customers still
    have access to their data.

--IAM Policy has
    version, id, statement
    statement has
        sid, effect, principal, action, resource

-- MFA
    three types of devices are there for MFAS
-- different ways to access AWS services
     AWS console using password and MFA
     command line interface- CLI using access key id and secret access key
     Software Development kit -SDK using access key id and secret access key

--aws cloud shell
--aws roles aws services like ec2
    what permissions ec2 has to access other aws resources

-- IAM Security tools
    IAM Credential Report (account-level)
        lists all IAM users and status of their credentials
    IAM Access Advisor (User Level)
        this shows services that the user can access and when those services were last accessed
--EC2
    types of EC2
        general purpose
        computer optimized
        memory optimized ( RAM)
        storage optimized(disk or ssd)


--- to connect to EC2 from local compute using ssh
     ssh -i '.\My Key Pair.pem' ec2-user@54.83.183.21
--EC2 instance purchasing options
    on demand   - very expensive
    spot instance  - very less expensive, given left over instances
    Reserved instances - 1 year - 30% discount
    Reserved instances - 3 years- 60% discount
    EC2 savings plan-  per hour base             28 discount
    Reserved convertible instances- 25% discount
    dedicated host- on demand - separate hardware
    dedicated host reservation
    capacity reservation
-- spot instances and spot fleets

--elastic Ip addresses
    if we associate elastic IP address to Ec2 instance, even after stopping and starting instance,
    public IP address will be same
--placement groups
    cluster
    spread
    partition

--Elastic Network Interface

--EC2 hibernate
