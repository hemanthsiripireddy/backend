Encryption:
    Encryption at flight(TLS and SSL)
        data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
        TLS certificates help with encryption
    Server side encryption at rest:
        data is encrypted after being received by the server
        data is decrypted before being sent
        it is stored in encrypted form (using keys)
    Client Side encryption:
        Data is encrypted by the server and never decrypted by the server
        data will be decrypted by a receiving client
        the server shouldn't not be able to decrypt the data
AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
    AWS manages encryption keys for us
    fully integrated with IAM for authorization
    able to audit KMS Key usage using cloud trail
    seamlessly integrated with most AWS Services(EBS, S3, RDS,SSM)
    KMS Key types:
        Symmetric(AES-256 keys)
            single key for both encryption and decryption
        Asymmetric (RSA and ECC key pairs)
            public and private key
    types of KMS keys
        AWS owned keys
        AWS Managed keys
        customer managed keys
    KMS Key policies
        control access to KMS keys
        Default KMS key policy:
            created if you don't provide a specific KMS key policy
            complete access to the key to the root user=entire AWS account
        Custom KMS key policy
            define users, roles that can access the  KMS key
            define who can administer the key
            useful for cross account access
