Ipv4 is divided into public and private Ipaddress
CIDR- classless Inter-Domain Routing
VPC- virtual private network
    you can multiple VPCs in AWS account (soft limit 5)
    max CIDR is 5 per VPC
        min size is /28 16 ip address
        max size is /16 65536 ip address
    Because VPC is private, only the private IP4 ranges are allowed
    you VPC CIDR should not overlap with you other networks (eg corporate)
VPC-subnet IPv4
    AWS reserves 5 IP addresses(first 4 and last 1) in each subnet
    these IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance
Internet gateway, Route table
Bastion Host
    we can use Bastion Host to SSH into our private EC2 instances
    the bastion is in public subnet which is then connected to all other private subnets
    Bastion Host security must allow inbound form the internet on port 22 from restricted CIDR, for example
        -public CIDR
    security group of the EC2 instances must allow the security group of the bastion Host or the private IP of bastion Host

NAT instance (outdated):
NAT: network address translation
    allows EC2 instances in private subnet to connect to internet
    must be launched in public subnet
    must disable EC2 setting: source/destination check
    must have elastice IP attached to it
    route tables must be configured to route traffic from private subnet to NAT instancew
NAT Gateway:
    AWS Managed NAT, higher bandwidth, high availability, no administration
    pay per hour per usage and bandwidth
    can't be used by EC2 instance in the same subnet (only from other subnets)
    requires an IGM (private subnet-> NATGW-> IGW)
    NAT Gateway with high availability:
        NAT Gateway is resilient within a single Availability zone
        must create multiple NAT Gateways in multiple AZs for fault tolerance
        there is no cross AZ failure needed because if an AZ goes down it doesn't need NAT
-------------------
NACL- Network access control list (NACL):
    NACL are like firewall which control traffic from and to subnets
    One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned the default NACL
    you define NACL Rules:
        Rules have a number (1-32766), higher precedence with a lower number
    newly created NACLs  will deny everything
    NACL are great way of blocking a specific IP address at the subnet level
Emphemeral Ports
    for any two endpoints to establish a connection, they must use ports
    clients connect to a defined port, and expect a response on an emphemeral port
security group                           vs NACL
operates at instance level                      operates at subnet level
supports allow rules only                       supports allow rules and deny rules
stateful: return traffic is automatically       stateless: return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules
allowed
all rules are evaluated before deciding whether  rules are evaluated in order(lowest to highest), first match wins
to allow traffic

--------------------------
VPC peering:
    privately connect two VPCs  using AWS network
    make them behave as if they were in the same network
    Must not have overlapping CIDRs
    VPC peering connection is NOT transitive
    (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate  with one another)
    you must update route tables in each VPC subnets to ensure EC2 instances can communicate with each other
    you can create VPC Peering connection between VPCs in different AWS accounts/regions
    you can reference  a security group  in a peered VPC (works cross accounts-same region)


VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)
    every AWS service publicly exposed (public URL)
    VPC endpoints allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public internet
    they are redundant and scale horizantally
    they remove the need of IGW, NATGW, to access AWS Services
    types of endpoints
        interface endpoints(powered by private link)
            supports most aws services
            pay per hour per gb
        gateway endpoints
            supports both S3 and DyanamoDB
            free
    gateway vs interface
        Gateway is most likely going to be preferred all the time
        interface in preferred access is required from onsite

VPC flow logs:

AWS Site-to-Site VPN
   Virtual Private Gateway(VPG):
     VPN Concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
     VGW is created and attached to VPC from which you want to create the site-to-site VPN connection
   Customer gateway:
     Software application or physical device  on customer side of the VPN Connection
     what IP address to use:
        public IP adress of customer gateway device
        if it's behind NAT, use NAT address
   note: enable route propagation for the virtual private gateway  in the route table that is associated with the subnet
   if you need to ping your EC2 instance from on-premises, make sure you add the ICMP protocol on the inbound of you security group

AWS VPN cloud hub:
    provide secure communication between multiple sites, if you have multiple VPN connections


Direct Connect (DX):
    provides a dedicated private connection from a remote network to you VPC
    Dedicated connection must be set up between you DC and AWS Direct connection locations
    you need to set up virtual private Gateway on your VPC
    access public (s3) and private resources(ec2) on same connection
    use cases:
        increase bandwidth through put -working with large data sets- lower cost
        more consistent network experience
        hybrid env (on prem + cloud)
    direct connect gateway:
        if you want to set up direct connect to one or more VPC in many different regions(same account), you must-
        use direct connect gateway
    Direct connect - connection types
        Dedicated connections: 1 GP, 10 GP, 1000 GP
            physical ethernet port dedicated to a customer
            request made to AWS first, then completed by AWS Direct Connect partners
        Hosted Connections: 50 Mbs to 10 Gps
            connections are made via AWS Direct connect partners
        lead times are often are longer than 1 month to establish a new connection
    encryption:
        data in transit is not encrypted, but private

Direct connect + site to site connection:
    In case direct fails, you can set up a backup direct connection(expensive), or a site to site VPN connection
Transit gateway:
    for having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on premises
    ring topology, all vpcs connnect to transit gateway and this gateway connect to on premise via site to site VPN
    or direct connect
    IP multi case supported only in transit gateway not in other services
    transit gateway: site to site VPN ECMP- equal cost multi path routing

VPC -traffic mirroring:
    allows you to capture and inspect network traffic in your  VPC
    route the traffic to security appliances that you manage
    capture all packets or capture the packets of your interest
    source and traget can be in same VPC or different VPC (vpc peering)
    use case:content inspection, threat monitoring, troubleshooting
    capture the traffic:
        from(Source): ENIs
        to targets- an ENIs or netowkr load balancer


egress only internet gateway:
    used for IPv6 only
    similar to NAT gateway but for IPV6
    allows instances in your VPC outbound connections over IPV6 while preventing the internet to initiate an IPv6 connection to your instances
    you must update the route table

AWS network firewall:
    protect your entire Amazon VPC
    from layer 3 to 7 protection
    Any traffic to inspect:
        VPC to VPC traffic
        outbound to internet
        inbound from internet
        to /from direct connect and site-to-site VPN
