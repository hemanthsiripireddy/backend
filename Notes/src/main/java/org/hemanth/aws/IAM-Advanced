AWS Organizations:
    Global service
    allows to manage multiple accounts
    The main account is the management account
    Other accounts are member accounts
    Member accounts can only be part of one organization
    Consolidated billing across all accounts - single payment method
Root organizational unit
    Dev organizational unit
    Prod organizational unit
AWS Organization
    advantages:
        Multi account vs one account multi VPC
        Use tagging standards for billing purpose
        Enable cloud trail logs on all accounts and send to central S3 bucket
        enable cross account roles for admin purposes
    Security: (Service control polices):
        IAM polices applied to OU or accounts to restrict users and roles
        they don't apply to management account
        Must have an explicit allow from the root through each OU in the direct path to the target
        group(doesn't allow anything by default-like IAM)

IAM Role vs resource based policy
    When you assume a role(User, application, Service), you give up your original permissions, and take the permissions
    assigned to the role
    when using resource based policy, the policy doesn't have to give up his permissions

User vs Role vs Group

IAM Policy evolution logic
    Deny evolution:
        
    Organizations SCPs(Service control policies)
        if a user has IAM policy that allows an action, but the SCP denies that action, the user is denied
        SCPS don't grant permissions, they only restrict them
    Resource based policies
     applies direclty on AWS resources (S3 bucket, SQS queue, SNS topic, Lambda function)
    Identity based policies
        applies to IAM users, groups, and roles
        define what actions the identity can perform on which resources.
        most commonly used for granting permissions
    IAM permissions boundaries
        optional advanced feature
        define the maximum permissions that an IAM entity(user or role) can have
        acts like a filter:  even  if an identity based policy allows an action, it must also be allowed by the permissions boundary
    Session policies
        temporary policies that are passed when assuming a role
        further restrict the permissions during the session
        useful for scoping down access dynamically
AWS IAM Identity center
    Multi account Permissions:
        Manage access across AWS accounts in your AWS organization
        Permission sets: a collection of one or more IAM policies assigned to users
        and groups to define AWS access
    Application assignments:
        SSO access to many SAML 2.0 applications
    Attribute based access control:
        Fined grained permissions based on users' attributes stored in IAM Identity center


AWS Directory Services:
    Microsoft Active Directory:
        found on any windows server with AD Domain services
        Database of objects: user accounts, computers, Printers, File shares, Security groups
        Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions
        objects are organized in trees, a group of trees is a forest
    AWS managed Microsft AD
        create your own AD in AWS, manager users locally, supports MFA
        establish trust connection with on premise AD
    AD connector:
        Directory gateway(proxy) to redirect to on prem AD, supports MFA
        users are managed on the on-premise AD
    Simple AD:
        AD- compatible managed directory on AWS
        cannot' be joined with on-premise AD
    IAM Identity center - Active Directory setup
        connect to aws managed Microsoft AD
        connec to self managed directory

IAM basics------------
access is denied unless explicitly allowed
users:
	Aws users are entities who are associated with security credentials accesskey and secretkey, have specific permissions to interact with AWS services
groups:
	groups are collection of users. it simplifies assigning of permissions to users in a one go, it reduces the burden of individually assigning permissions to each user
	by organsing users into groups, you can apply permissions to mulitple users simultaneously
Roles
	Role has a set of permission policies, what actions can be performed, what resources can be accessed, unlike  uses or groups, roles are not associated with entities, they can be
	assumed by aws services, IAM users
permission boundaries
	permission boundaries can be assiciated with users or groups, it  defines the maximum permission a user or group can have regardless of attached policies. it acts as access
	a addtional layer of control which prevents users or groups from exceeding a predetermined level access
	
AWS organizations
	AWS organizations help to centrally manage AWS accounts related to a company, it has a heiracial structure which is calleed OU organizational Unit and there root organizational
	accounts can be grouped under a OU , or can directly be associated to root, this structure helps consolidated billing,
	consolidation of multiple accounts into an organizational unit
	SCP- service control policy : is a set of restrictions that can be applied to root, OU, account. what actions or services are denied for the given unit. this helps centralized 
	security
	features:
		cross account access: facilitates cross account access by  enabling creation of Role that provides permission to access another account within the organization
	benifits of AWS organizations:
		cost optimization: consolidatin billing and gainging holistic view of resource utilization helps cost optimization more effectively. able to allocat cost to project or department prcisely
		Administrative efficiency: heirarcial structure of organization unit enhances administrative efficiency by allowing organizations to apply polices at different levels 
		. this streamlines management of permissions across the account
		Security: SCP empower organizations to enforce security measures by controlling access to specific AWS services
		Scalabiility: As Organizations grow, AWS organizations can scale with them, whether adding new accounts or adjusting hieracial structure 
		collabration and governance: 
			cross account access and tag policies facilitates collabration while maintaining governance
