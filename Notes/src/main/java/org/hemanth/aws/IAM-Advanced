AWS Organizations:
    Global service
    allows to manage multiple accounts
    The main account is the management account
    Other accounts are member accounts
    Member accounts can only be part of one organization
    Consolidated billing across all accounts - single payment method
Root organizational unit
    Dev organizational unit
    Prod organizational unit
AWS Organization
    advantages:
        Multi account vs one account multi VPC
        Use tagging standards for billing purpose
        Enable cloud trail logs on all accounts and send to central S3 bucket
        enable cross account roles for admin purposes
    Security: (Service control polices):
        IAM polices applied to OU or accounts to restrict users and roles
        they don't apply to management account
        Must have an explicit allow from the root through each OU in the direct path to the target
        group(doesn't allow anything by default-like IAM)

IAM Role vs resource based policy
    When you assume a role(User, application, Service), you give up your original permissions, and take the permissions
    assigned to the role
    when using resource based policy, the policy doesn't have to give up his permissions

User vs Role vs Group

IAM Policy evolution logic
    Deny evolution:
        
    Organizations SCPs(Service control policies)
        if a user has IAM policy that allows an action, but the SCP denies that action, the user is denied
        SCPS don't grant permissions, they only restrict them
    Resource based policies
     applies direclty on AWS resources (S3 bucket, SQS queue, SNS topic, Lambda function)
    Identity based policies
        applies to IAM users, groups, and roles
        define what actions the identity can perform on which resources.
        most commonly used for granting permissions
    IAM permissions boundaries
        optional advanced feature
        define the maximum permissions that an IAM entity(user or role) can have
        acts like a filter:  even  if an identity based policy allows an action, it must also be allowed by the permissions boundary
    Session policies
        temporary policies that are passed when assuming a role
        further restrict the permissions during the session
        useful for scoping down access dynamically
AWS IAM Identity center
    Multi account Permissions:
        Manage access across AWS accounts in your AWS organization
        Permission sets: a collection of one or more IAM policies assigned to users
        and groups to define AWS access
    Application assignments:
        SSO access to many SAML 2.0 applications
    Attribute based access control:
        Fined grained permissions based on users' attributes stored in IAM Identity center


AWS Directory Services:
    Microsoft Active Directory:
        found on any windows server with AD Domain services
        Database of objects: user accounts, computers, Printers, File shares, Security groups
        Centralized security management, create account, assign permissions
        objects are organized in trees, a group of trees is a forest
    AWS managed Microsft AD
        create your own AD in AWS, manager users locally, supports MFA
        establish trust connection with on premise AD
    AD connector:
        Directory gateway(proxy) to redirect to on prem AD, supports MFA
        users are managed on the on-premise AD
    Simple AD:
        AD- compatible managed directory on AWS
        cannot' be joined with on-premise AD
    IAM Identity center - Active Directory setup
        connect to aws managed Microsoft AD
        connec to self managed directory
