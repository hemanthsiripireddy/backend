Encryption:
    Encryption at flight(TLS and SSL)
        data is encrypted before sending and decrypted after receiving
        TLS certificates help with encryption
    Server side encryption at rest:
        data is encrypted after being received by the server
        data is decrypted before being sent
        it is stored in encrypted form (using keys)
    Client Side encryption:
        Data is encrypted by the server and never decrypted by the server
        data will be decrypted by a receiving client
        the server shouldn't not be able to decrypt the data
AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
    AWS manages encryption keys for us
    fully integrated with IAM for authorization
    able to audit KMS Key usage using cloud trail
    seamlessly integrated with most AWS Services(EBS, S3, RDS,SSM)
    KMS Key types:
        Symmetric(AES-256 keys)
            single key for both encryption and decryption
        Asymmetric (RSA and ECC key pairs)
            public and private key
    types of KMS keys
        AWS owned keys
        AWS Managed keys
        customer managed keys
    KMS Key policies
        control access to KMS keys
        Default KMS key policy:
            created if you don't provide a specific KMS key policy
            complete access to the key to the root user=entire AWS account
        Custom KMS key policy
            define users, roles that can access the  KMS key
            define who can administer the key
            useful for cross account access

KMW Multi-Region keys:
    Identical KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably
    Multi Region keys have the same key id, key material, automatic rotation
    Encrypt in one region and decrypt in other Regions
    no need to re Encrypt or making cross region api calls
    KMS Multi region are not global(primary and replicas)
    Each Multi Region key is managed independently
    Use Cases: Global client side encryption, encryption on global DynamoDB, Global Aurora
S3 Replication Encryption Considerations:
    Unencrpted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by Default
    Objects encrypted with SSE-C(customer encrypted key) can be replicated
    for Objects encrypted with SSE-KMS, you need to enable the option
        specify which KMS key to encrpt the objects within the target bucket
        adapt the KMS key policy for the target key
        An IAM Role with kms: decrypt for the source KMS key and kms:Encrypt for target KMS key
    you can use Multi-region AWS KMS keys but they are currently treated as independent keys by Amazon S3 (the objects still de decrypted and then encrypted)

Amamzon AMI sharing process encrypted via KMS:
    AMI in source account is encrypted with KMS Key from source account
    Must specify the image attribute to add a launch Permission which corresponds to the specified target account
    Must share the KMS Keys used to encrpted the snapshot the AMI with the target account/IAM policy
    the IAM role/user must have the Permissions to describeKey, Reencrpt*, Create Grant, decrypt
    when launching a new ec2 instace from the AMI optionally the target account can sepecify a new KMS Key in its own account  to re encrpt the volumes
SSM paramter store:
    secure store for environment variables and config values
    Optional seamlessl encryption with KMS
    serverless, scalable, durable, easy SDK
    Version tracking of configurations ands secrets
    Security through IAM
    Notifications with Amazon Event Bridge
    Integration with cloud formation
    SSM parameter store hierarchy:
        /my-dept 
            /my-app 
                dev/ 
                    db 
                    password
                prod/
                    db 
                    password
    Dev lambda function has only access to dev configs using IAM and same vice Version
    standard vs advaned parameter tiers
    paramters policies:
        allos to assign a TTL to a parameter (expiration date) to force updating or deleting sensitive data
    whereas AWS secret manager is used to store secrets, SSM for config and env variables


AWS Secrets Manager:
    Newer Service, meant for storing secrets
    Capability of force rotation of secrets every X days
    Automate generation of secrets on rotation(lambda)
    Integration with Amamzon RDS
    Secrets are encrpted with KMS
    mostly meant for RDS Integration
    Multi-region:
        Replicate Secrets across Multiple AWS Regions
        Secrets Manager keeps read replicas in sync  with the primary secret
        use cases: multi region apps, disaster recovery strategies, multi region db
AWS certificate Manager:
Web application firewell:

    layer 7 is http (layer 4 is TCP/UDP)
    deploy on 
        application load balancer
        API gateway
        cloudfront
        APPSync GraphQL API
        cognito user pool

    WEB ACL is regional except for cloudfront
    A rule group is a reusable set of rules that you cann add to a web ACL
    WAF doesn't not support the Network load balancer
    we can use global accelerator for fixed IP and WAF on ALB
