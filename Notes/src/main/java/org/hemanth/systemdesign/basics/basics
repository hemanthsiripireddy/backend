components of system design
framework used to solve system design problem in hour


in distributed systems,
    reliability is continue to work correctly when things go wrong, example: minimum functionalities are working
    minimum performance is achieved etc
    wrongs:
        faults: deviation of a component from it's usual behaviour
        failures: systems as a whole goes down, stops providing required services to user
        fault tolerant systems: a system that can anticipate faults and can cope up with them
    faults:
        hardware failure
        software: buggy code
        human error: 75-10% of outages are due to human error

Scalability:
    Systems able to cope up with the increased load
    load:
        web servers: throughput (req/sec), response times
        database server: reads/writes ratio
        cache: hit rates (70-80% is good)
        chat rooms: concurrent users, latency
    average cases matters the most
    generally measured in terms of
        mean
        median
        percentile (most common)

    percentile:
        defines our service level agreements(SLA)
        it allows to demand a refund if SLA's are breached
    handling scaling:
        vertical scaling
        horizontal scaling

maintainability:
    operable:
        making life easy for operations person, easy to monitor-transparent, automation, good documentation
    simple
        loose coupling between components, avoid hacks- adding if else instead of good abstraction
    evolvable:
        easy to add new features
resilient vs reliable:
    reliable system consistently performs intended functions without failure over a specified period of time
    resilient system: able to recover quickly and continue to operate even after a failure or disruption
types of APIs
    rest APIs
    soap APIs
    grpc APIs
    websocket APIs
    graphQL APIs
    webhooks
CAP theorem
    Consistency
    Availability
    Partition tolerance
    in distributed systems, we can only have two of the three properties at the same time
    most web services choose availability and partition tolerance over consistency
