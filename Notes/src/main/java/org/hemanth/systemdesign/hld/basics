client server architecture
    light clients
        process least amount of information and heavily rely on the server. ex: web browsers
    thick clients
        process larges amount of information and rely less on the server. ex: game applications, video editing applications
    2-tier architecture
        client-server
    3-tier architecture
        client-server-database
    n-tier architecture
        client - load balancer web server - application server - database server-database
Network protocols and proxies
    OSI Model
        application layer
        presentation layer
        session layer
        transport layer
        network layer
        data link layer
        physical layer
    TCP/IP Model
        Application Layer
        Transport Layer
        Internet Layer
        network Access Layer
    Common Protocols
        HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol: stateless
        TCP VS UDP
            TCP: connection-oriented, reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery of data. ex: web browsing, email, file transfer
            UDP: connectionless, faster but less reliable, no guarantee of order or error-checking. ex: video streaming, online gaming, VoIP
    Proxies
        farward Proxy
            acts on behalf of clients, masking their IP addresses and providing access control, caching, and anonymity.
        reverse Proxy
            acts on behalf of servers, distributing incoming requests, enhancing security, and providing load balancing.

    how does search works in applicatoins:
	indexing
	Ranking and relevence:
		TF(Term frequency):
		IDF: inverse document frequency
	prefix index or trie structure for auto complete
	
	advanced:
		vectors(embeddings)
		measure similatiry using cosine distance
