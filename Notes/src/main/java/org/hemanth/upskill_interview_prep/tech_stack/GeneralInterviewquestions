1. have you faced any performance issue in you application? if so, how have you solved it?
2. can you explain the high level architecture of your application?
3 what kind of caching have you used? inmemory vs distributed?
4 have you developed and implemented any API in your application? if so can you give details about that
5 have you faced any issue with your application? whare are the step you have taken to drill down the issue and find the root cause?
6 how are you monitoring the health of your system? what are the tools are you using for that?




1 How to improve API performance?
    Pagination:
        Instead of returning massive data in single response, break it into pages
        reduces payload size
        faster load time
        ideal for loading products
    Aync Logging: 
        logging synchonously blocks API calls:
        switch to asynchronous logging to reduct latency
    caching:
        store frequently accessed data in memory
        avoid repetitive DB calls
        serve low latency responses
    Connection pooling:
        creating repetitive database Connections is costly
        reuse active connections
        improve database performance dramtically
