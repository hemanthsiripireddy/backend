Comparable vs Comparator in java:
    Comparable:
        if a class implements Comparable<T>, means:
            that class decides how objects should be sorted
            sorting logic lives inside the class
            we can sort using collections.sort(list)
    Comparator:
        multiple sorting options
        sorting logic outside the class
        can't modify the class
    pros and cons of Comparable
        pros:
            less boiler code
            useful for default sorting
        cons:
            only one sorting rule is allowed
            requires modifing the class
            sorting logic stays inside the class
    pros and cons of Comparator:
        pros:
            unlimited sorting rules
            no modification of class required
            more flexible
            work beatifully with streams
        cons:
            more verbose
            everytime you start, you must specify the comparator
