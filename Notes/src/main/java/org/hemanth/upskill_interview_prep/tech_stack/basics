Comparable vs Comparator in java:
    Comparable:
        if a class implements Comparable<T>, means:
            that class decides how objects should be sorted
            sorting logic lives inside the class
            we can sort using collections.sort(list)
    Comparator:
        multiple sorting options
        sorting logic outside the class
        can't modify the class
    pros and cons of Comparable
        pros:
            less boiler code
            useful for default sorting
        cons:
            only one sorting rule is allowed
            requires modifing the class
            sorting logic stays inside the class
    pros and cons of Comparator:
        pros:
            unlimited sorting rules
            no modification of class required
            more flexible
            work beatifully with streams
        cons:
            more verbose
            everytime you start, you must specify the comparator


multithreading in java:
        we can create multithreading in java by two ways:
            extending thread class
            implementing runnable interface
            advantage of runnable interface over thread class:
                java supports only single inheritance, so if we extend thread class, we can't extend any other class
                by implementing runnable interface, we can extend another class as well
                when multiple threads share same data using runnable interface, it saves memory
                better CPU utilization
        we can create thread safe methods by:
            synchronized keyword
            using locks
