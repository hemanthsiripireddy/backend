2.why choose java, features of java?
why choose java?
    platform independent,
    Strong community and ecosystem
        has massive developer community, extensive libraries and frameworks, and tools that make development faster and easier.
    Performance and optimization
        while not fast as c++, java offers good performance with just-in-time (JIT) compilation and good memory management.
    versatility
        java is used in various domains, including web development, mobile apps (android), desktop applications, cloud services
    secutity
        java has built-in security features, such as the sandbox environment, which helps protect against malicious code.
features of java:
    object-oriented
        java is based on the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, which promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.
    platform independence
        java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
    automatic memory management
        java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
    multithreading
        built in support for concurrent programming,
    Dynamic and extensible
        classes can be loaded dynamically at runtime
    robust and secure
        strong type checking, exception handling, and memory management features
