it validates ability to design scalable, cost-efficient, and secure applications on AWS.
job is to plan, implement, and optimize cloud architectures based on business model
this involves choosing right AWS services, ensuring security and keeping costs low.


--cloudfront metrics are only available in the us-east-1 region in cloud watch.
--rds supports multi-az deployments for high availability and failover support., creates replica in different availability zone.
    synchronous replication ensures data consistency between primary and secondary instances.
--types of roles in IAM
    service role
    trusted entity role
    cross-account access role
    trigger role, service role, event source role
-- AWS Web Identity Federation, AWS Security Token Service (STS)
--for accessing S3 bucket, we may need IAM role, bucket policy, ACLs
--ACLs used in s3(to controle who can access the objects, buckets), and vpc, to control traffic at subnet level
