what is Cloud computing:
    access services on demand
    avoid large upfront investment
    pay for what you use
AWS data centers:
    AWS data centers host cloud services and servers
    data centers organized into Availability zones
    All data centers use AWS backbone network equipment 
-- 600+ point of presence
AWS well architected framework:
    set of best practices to help architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications
    6 pillars:
        operational excellence:
            perform operations as code, no human error
        security:
            stick to principle of least privilege
            enable multi factor authentication
        reliability:
            recover from failures quickly
            implement backup and restore strategy
        performance efficiency:
            optimizing application performance for responsibility and scalability is essential for positive user experience
            reduct latency
            chose right resource types and sizes
            use serverless architectures where possible
            monitor resources and applications
        cost optimization
            analyze expenditure over time
            use cost effective resources
            do not guess    
        sustainability
            understand your impact on environment
            maximize utilization of resources
       


AWS Local zones vs wavelength zone vs edge locations:
    local zones: extension of an AWS region that is geographically close to large population, industry, and IT centers. 
        used for latency sensitive applications, there are two local zones in India
        local zones are available in 26 locationls globally
    wavelength zones: this service deploys subset of AWS conpute and storage services within the infrastructure of telecom communication providers
        wavelength zones are available in 30+ cities across the globe
        infrastructure deployments that extend AWS infrastructure to the edge of the 5G network, to minimize latency for mobile and connected devices
    edge locations: data centers that are part of AWS content delivery network (CDN) used to deliver content to end users with low latency,
         there 600+ edge locations globally
