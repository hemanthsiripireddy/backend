what is Cloud computing:
    access services on demand
    avoid large upfront investment
    pay for what you use
AWS data centers:
    AWS data centers host cloud services and servers
    data centers organized into Availability zones
    All data centers use AWS backbone network equipment 
-- 600+ point of presence
AWS well architected framework:
    set of best practices to help architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications
    6 pillars:
        operational excellence:
            perform operations as code, no human error
        security:
            stick to principle of least privilege
            enable multi factor authentication
        reliability:
            recover from failures quickly
            implement backup and restore strategy
        performance efficiency:
            reduct latency
            chose right resource types and sizes
            use serverless architectures where possible
            monitor resources and applications
        cost optimization
            analyze expenditure over time
            use cost effective resources
            do not guess    
        sustainability
            understand your impact on environment
            maximize utilization of resources
       


AWS Local zones vs wavelength zone vs edge locations:
    local zones: extension of an AWS region that is geographically close to large population, industry, and IT centers. 
        used for latency sensitive applications, there are two local zones in India
    wavelength zones: infrastructure deployments that extend AWS infrastructure to the edge of the 5G network, to minimize latency for mobile and connected devices
    edge locations: data centers that are part of AWS content delivery network (CDN) used to deliver content to end users with low latency,
         there 600+ edge locations globally

topics
    build secure architectures
    build resilient systems
    build high performing systems
    build cost optimised systems

--AWS regions are connected through AWS backbone network, which is private and secure.

it validates ability to design scalable, cost-efficient, and secure applications on AWS.
job is to plan, implement, and optimize cloud architectures based on business model
this involves choosing right AWS services, ensuring security and keeping costs low.


--cloudfront metrics are only available in the us-east-1 region in cloud watch.
--rds supports multi-az deployments for high availability and failover support., creates replica in different availability zone.
    synchronous replication ensures data consistency between primary and secondary instances.
--types of roles in IAM
    service role
    trusted entity role
    cross-account access role
    trigger role, service role, event source role
-- AWS Web Identity Federation, AWS Security Token Service (STS)
--for accessing S3 bucket, we may need IAM role, bucket policy, ACLs
--ACLs used in s3(to controle who can access the objects, buckets), and vpc, to control traffic at subnet level
