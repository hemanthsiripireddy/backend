--requirement gathering
-- funcational requirments vs non-functional requirements
--MVP
--estimate- how many users expected, how munch api calls expected, etc
--system should be extensible to add more features in future
--first start with monolithic architecture, then move to microservices
--performance vs scalability tradeoff,
    performance: low latence, how fast the system responds to a request
    scalability: how well the system can handle increased load
-- don't invent the wheel, use existing solutions


HLD requirement gathering vs LLD requirement gathering
    HLD: business and system level
        focus is breadth , not depth
        you ask questions that affact:
            architecture
            technology choices
            scaling
            cost
            risk
        functional:
            what are the core use cases?
            who are the users?- roles
            what actions can each role perform?
            is this CRUD heavy or workflow based?
        non-functional:
            scalability: expected users now? after 1 years? after 5 years?
                peack traffic (festival sales etc)
                read heavy vs write heavy
            Availability:
                is 99% availability acceptable? or do we need 99.999%?
                is downtime acceptable? for how long?

            performance:
                max acceptable response time
            Security:
                authentication types?
                encryption requirements?
                compliance needs?
            data:
                estimated data growth over time?
                strong consistency needed? or eventual consistency acceptable?
            example:
                - 1 million registered users
                - 100k daily active users
                - 10k peak concurrent users
                - 99.9% availability
                - payment and order service must be strongly consistent
                - latency less than 200ms for 95% of requests
        LLD:
            API level question:
                exact request and response structure
                mandatory vs optional fields
                error codes
                pagination format?
            business requirments:
                can order be cancelled after shipping?
                partial refunds allowed?
                retry behaviour on failure?
                Idempotency requireed?
            data level qeustions:
                which fields require indexing?
                unique constraints?
                hard delete vs soft delete?
                audit fields needed?
            concurrency and edge cases:
                what if two requests update the same record?
                optimistic vs pessimistic lockging?
                how to handle duplicate requests?
            HLD:
                users:
                    customers,
                    admins
                funcational requirements
                    user can place orders
                    user can track orders
                    admin can manage inventory
                non-functional requirements
                    system should handle 10k concurrent users
                    99.9% uptime
                    latency less than 200ms for 95% of requests
                constraints:
                    must run on AWS
                    MVP by 3 months
                    
            LLD:
                create order
                cancel order
                get order by id
