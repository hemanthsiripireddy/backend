--requirement gathering
-- funcational requirments vs non-functional requirements
--MVP
--estimate- how many users expected, how munch api calls expected, etc
--system should be extensible to add more features in future
--first start with monolithic architecture, then move to microservices
--performance vs scalability tradeoff,
    performance: low latence, how fast the system responds to a request
    scalability: how well the system can handle increased load
-- don't invent the wheel, use existing solutions
