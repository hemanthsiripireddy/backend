Database Management and Storage
    1. We are building an e-commerce order history service, would you use relational database or no-sql, why?
    key concepts: ACID concepts, structured data vs unstructured data, complex joins
    2 our API is getting slow because of heavey database reads. how would you introduce a cache?(Redis Memcache)
    -- follow up: what is your cache invalidation policy? (LRU/LFU). how do you handle cache invalidation when data updates?

Communication and concurrency:
    Rest vs RPC vs GraphQL
        when would you chose gRPC over rest for inter service communication?
    Synchronous vs Asynchronour Communcation:
        A user uploads a massive video file to be processed. if we process it synchronously, the connection time outs, how do you handle it?
        Expected answer: message queues (Rabbit MQ/ Kafka) for asynchronous processing
    handling concurrency:
        two users try to book the last seat on a flight at a exact milli second, how would you prevent double booking?
    key concepts: database lockging (optimistic locking vs pessimistice locking

Resilience and Operational Excellence:
    writes code that handles failures gracefully
    circuit breaking:
        Service A calls Service B, Service B is down, how do you prevent service A hanging and crashing the whole system?
    Idempotency:
        A client clicks the pay button twice because of lag, how do you ensure they aren't charged twice?
    bottlenecks:
        I'll point to a specific part of you design(e.g database instance) and ask what happens if this specific instance fails
