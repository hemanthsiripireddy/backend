Caching: which cache to use in which situaion:
    1 In memory cache(Local Cache-> caffeine, Guava)
        best for
            ultra low latency reads,
            single instance services,
            caching small frequently accessed data
            computation heavy results
        Distributed Cache(Redis, Memcached)
            microservices
            shared across instances
            user sessions, tokens
        CDN cache (Cloud front, Akamai, Fastly)
            static assests (CSS, JS, images)
            API edge caching
            Global Distributed and low latency for users worldwide
        Database query cache:
            (database or ORM level: Hibernate L2 Cache)
            best for repeated read heavy DB queries
